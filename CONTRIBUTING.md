First off, thank you for considering contributing to JBoss Metadata. It's people like you that make Jastow such a great tool. JBoss Metadata  is an open source project, and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Jastow itself.

We expect all contributors and users to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when communicating through project channels. These include, but are not limited to: chat, issues, code.

# One time setup

## Create a GitHub account

If you don't have one already, head to https://github.com/

## Fork JBoss Metadata

Fork https://github.com/jboss/metadata/fork into your GitHub account.

## Clone your newly forked repository onto your local machine

```bash
git clone git@github.com:[your username]/metadata.git
cd metadata
```

## Add a remote reference to upstream

This makes it easy to pull down changes in the project over time

```bash
git remote add upstream git://github.com/jboss/metadata.git
```

# Development Process

This is the typical process you would follow to submit any changes to jastow.

## Pulling updates from upstream

```bash
git pull --rebase upstream 2.2.x
```

> Note that --rebase will automatically move your local commits, if you have 
> any, on top of the latest branch you pull from.
> If you don't have any commits it is safe to leave off, but for safety it
> doesn't hurt to use it each time just in case you have a commit you've
> forgotten about!
## Discuss your planned changes (if you want feedback)

 * jastow Issue Tracker - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBMETA

## Create a simple topic branch to isolate your work (recommended)

```bash
git checkout -b my_cool_feature
```

## Make the changes

Make whatever code changes, including new tests to verify your change, are necessary and ensure that the build and tests pass.

```bash
mvn clean verify
```

> If you're making non code changes, the above step is not required.
## Commit changes

Add whichever files were changed into 'staging' before performing a commit:

```bash
git commit
```

## Rebase changes against main

Once all your commits for the issue have been made against your local topic branch, we need to rebase it against branch 2.2.x in upstream to ensure that your commits are added on top of the current state of main. This will make it easier to incorporate your changes into the main branch, especially if there has been any significant time passed since you rebased at the beginning.

```bash
git pull --rebase upstream 2.2.x
```

## Push to your repo

Now that you've sync'd your topic branch with upstream, it's time to push it to your GitHub repo.

```bash
git push origin my_cool_feature
```

## Getting your changes merged into upstream, a pull request

Now your updates are in your GitHub repo, you will need to notify the project that you have code/docs for inclusion.

 * Send a pull request, by clicking the pull request link while in your repository fork
 * After review a maintainer will merge your pull request, update/resolve associated issues, and reply when complete
 * Lastly, switch back to branch main from your topic branch and pull the updates

```bash
git checkout 2.2.x
git pull upstream 2.2.x
```

 * You may also choose to update your origin on GitHub as well

```bash
git push origin
```

## Some tips

Here are some tips on increasing the chance that your pull request is accepted:

 * Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
 * Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it
